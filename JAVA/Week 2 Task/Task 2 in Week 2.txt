1.	What does the “static” keyword mean ?

		It's simply use to call the methods without creating any object in main method.we can use this keyword with variables,methos,blocks 		and nested class.


2.	Can you override private or static method in Java ?

		NO,we can't override private methods because we cann't access privite method from other methods.

		yes,we can override Static methods and it will access from any method.


3.	Can you access non static variable in static context ?

		we can access non-static variable in ststic variable by creating an object.With out create any object we cann't access.


4.	What are the Data Types supported by Java ?

		Generally java supports two types of data types 

				i) .Primitive Datatype
				ii).Reference/object Datatype


	Primitive datatype:
	------------------

		In java we have Eight Primitive data types these are predefined.
		
		byte:
		-----
			It is a 8 bit singed two's complement integer and its size is -(2^7) t0 +(2^7-1).

		short:
		------
			It is a 16 bit singed two's complement integer and its size is -(2^15) t0 +(2^15-1).

		int:
		----
			It is a 32 bit singed two's complement integer and its size is -(2^31) t0 +(2^31-1).
			It is used to stored the int values.
		
		Long:
		-----
			It is a 64 bit singed two's complement integer and its size is -(2^63) t0 +(2^63-1).
			it is also used to stored the integer value but it sore's larger values then the

		float:
		------
			It is a single-precision 32 bit IEEE 754 floating point and its is used to save point values.
		
		double:
		-------
			
			It is a single-precision 64 bit IEEE 754 floating point and it is used to default data types in decimal values.

		boolean:
		--------
			It represent one bit of information there are two possible values True and False.

		Char:
		-----
			It is a single 16-bit unicode and the minimum and maximum value is 14000 and 14fff.It is used to store any charecter.


	Reference datatype:
	-------------------
		 
		Reference variable can be created using defined constructor of the classes and they are used to access objects.
		Default value of any reference variable is null	




5.	What is Autoboxing and Unboxing ?

		Autoboxing:-
		------------

			Automatically primitive data type is converted in to object data type is called Autoboxing.

		AutoUnboxing:-
		--------------
			Automatically object data type is converted in to primitive data type is called Autounboxing.


6.	Difference between an Interface and an Abstract class ?


		Abstract class								Interface

	i)  .It can have abstract and non-abstract methods.			i)  .Interface can have only abstract methods.

	ii) .Abstract class doesn't support multiple inheritance.		ii) .Interface supports multiple inheritance.

	iii).It can have final,non-final,static and non-static variables.	iii).Interface has only static and final variables.

	iv) .these class can have static methods, main method and constructor.	iv) .Interface can't have static methods, main method or constructor.

	v)  .Abstract class can provide the implementation of interface.	v)  .Interface can't provide the implementation of abstract class.

	vi) .The abstract keyword is used to declare abstract class.		vi) .The interface keyword is used to declare interface.


7.	What is the difference between pass by reference and pass by value ?


		In passby reference we pass the object reference so if any  change is made it will directly effect the value but 
		
		in pass by value we send a copy of value so any change made will not affect the original value.



8.	What are the basic interfaces of Java Collections Framework ?


	interfaces in java collections are
		1)set:-hash set,tree set,linked set
		2)list:-Arraylist,Linked list,vector
		3)map:-sortedmap,hashmap,hashtable,tree map.


9.	Why do we use an Iterator while using Java Collections ?


	1)iterator:it has 3 methods and moves only in forward direction.
	
				i)  .hasNext():to check whether there are elements in javacollection or not
                      		ii) .next():it is used to print the next element
                            	iii).remove():it is used to remove elements.




10.	What is the difference betweenHashMap and Hashtable ?

	Performance of hashtable is less when compared to hashmap because hashtable is synchronous and hasmap is unsynchronous.Hashmap accepts
	nullss values where as hashtable does not accept null values. 



11.	What is difference between Array and ArrayList ? When will you use Array over ArrayList ?


					Array							Arraylist
					-----							---------


	i)  .Array is static in size that is fixed length data structure	i)  .ArrayList is dynamic in size and it is Resizable.

	ii) .Array contain both Array and Primitive type data types		ii) .ArrayList can not contains primitive data types.

	iii).We can use for loop or for each loop to iterate through array 	iii).We can use iterator  to iterate through ArrayList.

	iv) .In performance wise arry is faster then Arraylist.			iv) .In performance wise arrylist is solwer then Array.

	v)  .Array is Multidimentional.						v)  .Array is Single diamentional.

	vi) .In array we insert elements using the assignment operator.		vi) .In Arraylist we insert elements using the add() method.



12.	When to use parseInt method?


	The parseInt method converts the String to an int, and throws a NumberFormatException if the string can’t be converted to an int type.



13.	What is the difference between StringBuffer and StringBuilder class?

	StringBuffer:
	-------------

	StringBuffer is mutable means one can change the value of the object . The object created through StringBuffer is stored in the heap.

	StringBuffer is thread safe and its performance is veryslow.


	StringBuilder:
	--------------

		StringBuilder is used stores the object in heap and it can be modified and it'sperformance is fast.



14.	What is finalize method?

	finalize :
	----------
		 It is a method always invoked by garbage collector just before distroying a object to perform cleanup activities.

		 It perform cleanup activity related to object.
	
		 What ever the resources assosiated with object will be delocated before distroying an object method by using finalize method.



15.	What is the difference between final, finally and finalize method?

	final:
	------
		* final is a keyword and it is use as modifier applicable for classes methods and variable

		* It is not applicable for inheritance(we can't create child class).
		
		* final method is not overridden.

		* final variable is can't change.

	finally :
	---------
		* It is a block allways assosiated with try-catch to maintain cleanup code.

		* The specialty of this finanny block is it will be excuted always irrespective of exception is raised (or) not raised and 
		   handeled (or) not handeled.

	finalize :
	----------
		* It is a method always invoked by garbage collector just before distroying a object to perform cleanup activities.

		* It perform cleanup activity related to object.
	
		* What ever the resources assosiated with object will be delocated before distroying an object method by using finalize method.


16.	What is the difference between throw and throws keyword?


	throw:
	------
		* The main object of throw keyword is to hand over our created object to the JVM manuvally.

		* Checked exception cann't propagated using throw only.

		* Throw is used with in method.

		* you con't throw multiple exceptions.

		* Best use of throw key word is for user defined exceptions(or)Customized Exception.

	throws :
	-------
		* The main object of throws is to delecate responsibility of exceptionhandling to the caller(it may be another method (or) JVM).

		* Here caller method is responsible to the exception.

		* throws key word is require only checked exceptions.

		* You can declare multiple exceptions by using throws

				Ex :- public void method()throws IOException,SQLException. 


17.	When and why to use “super” keyword ?

	Super
	-----
		Super keyword is used in inheritance if you use super keyword we can't override the parentclass methods.


18.	What is “jar” file and how to create and use it?


	The JAR file format is based on the popular ZIP file format. Usually these file are used for archiving and distribution the files and 		implementing various libraries, components and plug-ins in java applications it archives dot class files.

	We will create the Jarfile two ways by using Java’s jar command as well as using Eclipse IDE.

	Java’s jar command to create java file :- jar cf JAR_FILE_NAME FILE_NAMES_OR_DIRECTORY_NAME
		
			Ex:-jar cf MyApp1.jar C:\JavaProject\MyApp.

	JAR file using Eclipse IDE :-
	-----------------------------

		Creating JAR file using Eclipse IDE is pretty much easy. Follow the simple steps.Right click on your project, which you want to 		create a JAR file of. And select Export from the context menu.Select JAR file from Java folder and click Next.Provide the Destination 			path and click on Finish to create the JAR.


19.	What is the purpose of fileInputStream and fileReader class?

	FileInputStream :-
	------------------

		Stream is used to binary input/output.FileinputStream is Byte Based.

		FileInputStream and ObjectInputStream can be used forSerialization(object is converted into byte) and DeSerialization(byte tocobject)

		FileInputStream.read() reads 1 byte (8-bit) at a time.

		FileInputStream must be used when we arereading audio, video or other multimedia files.

	FileReader :-
	-------------
		Reader is Character Based and it is used character input/output.

		FileReader is not used for Serialization and DeSerialization.

		FileReader.read() reads 2 bytes(16-bit) at a time.

		FileReader must be used when we are reading text files,pdfs or word documents.



20.	What is the purpose of fileOutputStream and fileWriter class?


	FileoutputStream :-
	-----------------
		A file output stream is an output stream for writing data to a File or to a FileDescriptor.

		It is used for writing streams of characters.For writing streams of raw bytes, consider using a FileOutputStream. 
		
	FileWriter :-
	-------------
		Java FileWriter class is used to write character-oriented data to the file.
		
		FileOutputStream is meant for writing streams of raw bytes such as image data.For writing streams of characters, consider using 			FileWriter.
